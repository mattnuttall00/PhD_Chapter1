# analysis of grouse
# import data file
GROUSE<-read_csv("grouse_shooting_mod.csv")
str(GROUSE)

# your first step will need to be recoding some variables as factors
GROUSE$moor<-factor(GROUSE$moor)
GROUSE$drive<-factor(GROUSE$drive)


# now we will want to divide nr_shot by drive size to facilitate contrasts
GROUSE$shotperkm<-GROUSE$nr_shot/GROUSE$km2
# then examine distribution
hist(GROUSE$shotperkm)
# variable is bounded below and count data
# to keep things simple, let's see if a log transform will help
hist(log(GROUSE$shotperkm))
# looks like this will be better even if not perfect
# let's store the vector for later use
GROUSE$shot<-log(GROUSE$shotperkm)

# the counts will similarly need a log transform
GROUSE$count<-log(GROUSE$totalcount)

# now plot the relationship and predict effects
plot(shot~count,data=GROUSE)
# looks like a positive linear relationship (in log-log space), with slope approx 1
plot(shot~jitter(prev),data=GROUSE)
# looks like a negative relationship, maybe with slope around -0.5??

# but recall that we would really like to know ahead of time whether there is an interaction
# let's build a plot that separately illustrates the effects of previous shooting number on count
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(GROUSE, aes(x = count, y = shot)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_grid(. ~ prev)
# there is no strong evidence from these plots for an interaction, because the lines are more or less parallel
# however, it does look like the numbers of shot grouse are highest in the first shooting, followed by the second and third 


# to start, let's keep things simple with the maximal linear model
g1<-lm(shot~count*prev,data=GROUSE)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(g1)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
# QQ plot looks a bit weak, others OK
summary(g1)
# guess at coefficient for count not bad, but other suffers -- however interaction still in so model needs simplifying

g2<-update(g1,~. -count:prev)
anova(g1,g2)
# simpler model better, as expected

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(g2)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
# QQ maybe slightly better, still a bit poor
summary(g2)
# now guess for coefficients quite good, and supported statistically

# can't simplify further, because p-vals for linear models are already for p-on-deletion

# problems is that this linear model features pseudoreplication
# both moor and drive visited repeatedly, and would like to soak up the variance assoc with these factors

# but having done the fixed version of the model gives us a good idea of what to expect from a successful mixed mode, so it was worth starting there!


#Extending the linear model to account for pseudoreplication

#We know that we also have repeated measurements for some drives (hunting area) and drive is nested within moor (management unit owned by a single land owner). We need to address this by specifying the random effects in the model. 

# What if we didn't use mixed effects models and added moor and drive as fixed effects? Let's try it out. 

g4<-lm(shot~moor+drive+prev+count,data=GROUSE)
summary(g4)

#Why are there NA estimates in the summary output?
# Try these tables which tell you how many of each combination of moor and drive (and previous numbers of shootings) there are
xtabs(~moor+drive,data=GROUSE)
xtabs(~moor+drive+prev,data=GROUSE)

# most combinations are poorly represented, and the small overall sample means we don't have the degrees of freedom to estimate all the coefficients needed for a fixed model

#Let's try the same analysis in a mixed effect model framework. In mixed effects models, we need to specify the random part of the model.
# I prefer the syntax of lme4 to that of nlme, but both are OK

# notice how there are no p-values, because it's not clear what denominator df are in mixed models

# notice the message in red telling us that R has refit the models using a different estimation procedure -- we compare models fit with ML, but report coefficients fit with REML
# the simpler model is preferred (if we believe the likelihood ratio test method for testing significance)
# but behaviour of chi squared biased, so best to apply Kenward Roger correction or conduct parametric bootstraps
# both implemented in package pbkrtest
#######

# when using pbkrtest package, always ensure the simpler model is listed second, or else the function will fail

# can't lose count either
# if we care about p-values, we can use either KR or pb values


# so min adequate model is g2.mixed
summary(g2.mixed)
# coeffs similar but not identical to those in fixed model
# also similar to published table, but note that Bunnefeld et al model shooting event number as a factor
# They may have reasoned that because the 3 or 4 shootings category was binned, modelling prev as a factor did not constrain the outcome of that group's coefficient as much as if it were a continuous predictor. In fact, there is little difference between models.


# why are df known for model simp, but not for tests of coefs?

# could also compare models with AIC
# because sample is small, may prefer AICc
# may need to install MuMIn, which has one implementation of AICc
library(MuMIn)

AICc(g1.mixed,g2.mixed,g3.mixed,g4.mixed)
# methods are in agreement
# best model is g2.mixed

#The summary looks like the one from linear models, but we have additional parts here. The most important are the variances of the random effects and th enumber of observations to check that we have done the right thing. Try to understand the three different parts, the random effects, the fixed effects and the data structure (Number of obs).



#Now do a variance components analysis, which is basically extracting the variance from the random effects and calculating the relative contribution of each term of the random effects to the total variation explained by the random effects. Extract the variance for all levels plus the residual variance from the summary().

# visualizing fits
# plotting from mixed models used to be somewhat clunky
# the code below is Nils Bunnefeld's (slightly modified) code that extracts coefficients from his model summaries and uses those to plot lines

# # Mixed model coefficients are hard to translate directly into plots because the coeffs are mean centred
# So one common approach is to use coeffs from fixed models (assuming they are representative of those of mixed models)
# In the code below, Nils uses his coeffs from a fixed model including prev as a categorical variable
